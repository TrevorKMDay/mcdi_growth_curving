    \section{Introduction}

    The Baby Connectome Project (BCP) % CITE
    collected MacArthur-Bates \glspl{cdi} % CITE
    beyond the typical normed range of
    8--18 months. This means it is unclear how to interpret scores beyond this
    range.

    \section{Methods}

    I acquired CDI \gls{ws} data from Wordbank % CITE
    (Feb. 15. 2023), comprising $n=7905$ unique individuals with an age field
    between 16--30 months.
    The Wordbank data were divided into a training set (75\% of the data at each
    age) and a testing set (the remaining 25\%).

    All \gls{wg} items appear on \gls{ws}, with the exception of ``in'' and
    ``inside,'' which is two items on the \gls{wg} form and one on \gls{ws}. For
    the \gls{wg} score, an endorsement of the ``inside/in'' item was scored as
    two \textit{words produced}. 
    
    

    Within each category, I regressed the difference against age (in months
    since 18 months, the youngest age that \gls{ws} is normed for) and the
    calculated \gls{wg} score, and the interaction between them.
    
        For each participant's inventory score (e.g. \sounds{}, \textit{Animals},
    $\ldots$), I calculated the total number
    of items endorsed, and the total number of items endorsed, counting only those that also
    appear on the \gls{wg} form, see \autoref{fig:allWGWS}.
    The lowest $R^2$ of the quadratic regression of \gls{ws} on \gls{wg}
    was \hverbs{} at 0.694, but the rest exceeded 0.890.
    
    \begin{figure}

    	\caption{True WS scores ($y$) against score using only WG items ($x$).
    		$R^2$ values: action_words: 0.993; animals: 0.996; body_parts: 0.985;
    		clothing: 0.980; connecting_words: N/A;
    		descriptive_words: 0.989; food_drink: 0.973;
    		furniture_rooms: 0.992; games_routines: 0.966; helping_verbs: 0.694;
    		household: 0.993; locations: 0.911; outside: 0.973; people: 0.974;
    		places: 0.942; pronouns: 0.947; quantifiers: 0.951;
    		question_words: 0.99; sounds: 1.00; time_words: 0.976; toys: 0.899;
    		vehicles: 0.966.}
    	
    	\label{fig:allWGWS}
    	
    \end{figure}

    An additional key problem is that no \cwords{} items appear on the \gls{wg}
    form. Secondly, \sounds{} is identical between the two forms. These two categories are
    ignored for the total-score analyses to be more conservative in estimates of error rate.

    \section{Results}

    The Pearson correlation between the true \gls{ws} score and the calculated
    \gls{wg} score for each individual/category was $r=0.962$ (Spearman $r=0.968$).
    Mean differences
    by category across ages are shown in \autoref{fig:diffs_by_cat}. Notably
    large differences emerge in \food{}, \textit{Action Words},
    and \textit{Descriptive Words}, whereas statistically no differences emerge
    in \sounds{} and \textit{Question Words}. Despite the lack of \cwords{},
    statistically significant differences don't seem to emerge until 23 months, and
    even then never exceed a mean underestimate of more than 2 words.

    \subsection{Total Score}

    Within each
    category, I regressed the ground-truth \gls{ws} score on age,
    \gls{wg} score, the
    age--score interaction, as well as age$^2$, WG$^2$ and the interaction of
    the quadratic terms. The quadratic terms were included because of the
    clear nonlinearity of the age effect in development, as well as the
    nonlinear effect of \gls{wg} score on true \gls{ws} score
    (\autoref{fig:allWGWS}).

    \autoref{fig:error} shows the error rate among the test sample. As can be
    seen in \autoref{subfig:err}, most participants are estimated to within
    50 words of their true valeu. Furthermore, the percent error is small, with
    the exception of participants with a very low ground-truth WS score
    \autoref{subfig:allpcterr}.
    Using 50 words as a cutoff (part of the Delay 3+ criterion), percent error
    rates are typically within 15\% (\autoref{subfig:gt50pcterr}).
